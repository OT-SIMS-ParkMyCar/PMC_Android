# PMC_Android

The application PMC_Android is an Android project to use with [PMC_Server](https://github.com/OT-SIMS-ParkMyCar/PMC_Server).

Have you never struggle when looking for a place in Paris or NYC or London or Vonnas ? (Of course you need a car first,
but its not my point here). 

PMC stands for Park My Car. This project is about creating an android application to help drivers
to find quickly a place to park their car. 

## How to use
Very simple. You just need to drive. Our app will find places arround 200 m from your position and will give you at the same time some informations about the status of the local areas (fine, some traffic or overloaded parkings). In order to follow useful information, we added a time show on a place that indicate when the last person has indicate the status of that place.
Of course, you can also get the status of an area and its places not only in your current position but also in another destination by simply giving a address or by just longly clicking the map.
