# PMC_Android

Have you never struggle when looking for a place in Paris or NYC or London or Vonnas ? (Of course you need a car first,
but its not my point here). 

PMC stands for Park My Car. This project is about creating an android application to help drivers
to find quickly a place to park their car.
